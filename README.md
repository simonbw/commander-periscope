## Contributing

There are plenty of TODOs in the code.
Feel free to grab one and start working on it.

Some bigger things that need to be done:
 
 - Take a bunch of the strings that are scattered throughout the code and put them into constants. Any that are shared between client and server code should go in the `common` folder.
 
 - Make it look good. Basically all the pages look like garbage right now.
